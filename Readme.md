Science like the Arts should not be confined to only those who practice professionally or within institutions. Experimentation and the Scientific Method is open to all and to be practiced across disciplines, ages and orientations.

Our project, entitled Eavesdropping on Nature: DIY Bioacoustics, attempts to create an open source scientific method, through accessibility and radical consent to learn through, be entertained by and do science in public.

The project was conceived as a response to the inaugural edition of Cambridge University’s “Biomaker Challenge” which led to collaboration with the John Innes Centre for Plant and Microbial Science on an acoustic sensor which translates the ultrasonic calls of the Cicadellidae or “Leafhopper” into audible signals. 
 
We think that if citizens can build, hack and augment their own Bioacoustic listening devices then the potential to engage with and look after the health of ecological systems will increase exponentially. We hope to achieve this by creating a temporary scientific community and institution, located beside the historic Exhibition Road, which is open to all and centred around the study of the insect and its interaction with plants. 

This liberation of ecological sound matched with the transformative power of Citizen Science and the deployment of DIY technologies can increase public understanding of and engagement with a variety of ecological phenomena, as well as share rapidly developing technologies, resources and knowledge. We want to enable people to access a tune that has not been audible before; to understand, in a qualitative sense, the acoustic structure and polyphony of ecological systems that surround us.
